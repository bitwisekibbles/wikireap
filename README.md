# WikiReap

> Note: I have plans to move WikiReap over to the C programming language from python. It will use the libCurl to fetch webpages and libTidy to parse the webpage. This should result in faster, smaller, and compilable code.

WikiReap is a tool that can be used to turn information from Wiki pages into notes.
